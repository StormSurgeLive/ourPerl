#  This script performs a Peaks Over Threshold analysis 
#  on WIS wave data (provided in the "oneline" file format
#
#  It uses the POT method described Yoshimi Goda, 2010, 
#  "Random Seas and Design of Maritime Structures"  3rd edition.
#  Chapter 13 Statistical analysis of Extreme waves, and implemented
#  in the GodaXtreme.pm package
